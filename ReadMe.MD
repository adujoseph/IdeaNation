Build such a system where one party proposes an idea to get sponsor and amount of initial funding, which in case it is accepted sponsor pays the initial funding and a new token is issued where the sponsor gets X% of the tokens. The rest of the tokens ( (100-X)% ) are given to the proposal owner. Bonus points if tokens are released gradually over time.
